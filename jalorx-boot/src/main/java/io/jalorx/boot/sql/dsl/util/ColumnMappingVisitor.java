/**
 * Visitor for all column mappings. Various column mappings are used by insert and update
 * statements. Only the null and constant mappings are supported by all statements. Other mappings
 * may or may not be supported. For example, it makes no sense to map a column to another column in
 * an insert - so the ColumnToColumnMapping is only supported on update statements.
 *
 * <p>Rather than implement this interface directly, we recommend implementing one of the derived
 * classes. The derived classes encapsulate the rules about which mappings are applicable to the
 * different types of statements.
