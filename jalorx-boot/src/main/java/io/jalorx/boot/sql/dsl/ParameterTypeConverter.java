/**
 * A parameter type converter is used to change a parameter value from one type to another
 * during statement rendering and before the parameter is placed into the parameter map. This can be used
 * to somewhat mimic the function of a MyBatis type handler for runtimes such as Spring that don't have
 * a corresponding concept.
 *
 * <p>Since Spring does not have the concept of type handlers, it is a best practice to only use
 * Java data types that have a clear correlation to SQL data types (for example Java String correlates
 * automatically with VARCHAR). Using a parameter type converter will allow you to use data types in your
 * model classes that would otherwise be difficult to use with Spring.
 *
 * <p>A parameter type converter is associated with a SqlColumn.
 *
 * <p>This interface is based on Spring's general Converter interface and is intentionally compatible with it.
 * Existing converters may be reused if they are marked with this additional interface.
 *
 * <p>The converter is only used for parameters in a parameter map. It is not used for result set processing.
 * It is also not used for insert statements that are based on an external record class. The converter will be called
 * in the following circumstances:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Parameters in a general insert statement (for the Value and ValueWhenPresent mappings)</li>
 *     <li>Parameters in an update statement (for the Value and ValueWhenPresent mappings)</li>
 *     <li>Parameters in a where clause in any statement (for conditions that accept a value or multiple values)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <S> Source Type
 * @param <T> Target Type
 *
 * @see SqlColumn
